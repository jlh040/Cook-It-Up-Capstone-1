### Project Title:

- **Cook It Up**
  - Check out my app at: https://cook-it-up.herokuapp.com/

### Goal:

- Cook-it-Up's goal is to allow users to cook a delicious meal all on their own! This site makes it easy to cook, by removing unnecessary details usually found on cooking websites and focusing on one thing: giving you the information you need to cook your next meal up!

### Features:

- Cook It Up gives you access to 5000+ recipes to make sure you have a wide variety of dishes to choose from. 
- You are able to search for a dish by name in case you already have in mind what you'd like to eat. 
- You can also sort dishes by calories and see the amount of calories for each dish just in case you want dishes that adhere to a certain diet plan.
- Every dish comes with a picture, required equipment, and a set of instructions for how to bring the dish to life. All these details are displayed in a clear layout to make it easy for you to cook.
- You can favorite any dish on the site so that you will always be able to easily recall how to cook a dish that you enjoyed
- You have your own profile page which contains all your site information and links to your favorite recipes to ensure you never have to search the site looking for your favorite recipes.
- If you'd like to change your username, first name, email, or profile image, feel free to do so by editing your profile.

### How-to:

1. First create an account by providing a few pieces of personal information.
2. Once your account is created you will be taken to the site's homepage, where you will have the option of choosing a dish by its cuisine type, or by searching for it by name & calorie number.
3. Click on the recipe name and get cookin'!
