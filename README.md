### Goal:

<<<<<<< HEAD
- The goal that my website aims to achieve, is to allow users to cook a delicious meal all on their own!
- In terms of demographics, I will be building this app for young professionals age 18-35. These people will most likely be living alone, and will also be single, which will prompt them to seek an easy way to cook a meal for themselves, since they have no one else to rely on.
