### Goals:

- The goal that my website aims to achieve, is to allow users to cook a delicious meal all on their own! 
- In terms of demographics, I will be building this app for young professionals age 18-35. These people will most likely be living alone, and will also be single, which will prompt them to seek an easy way to cook a meal for themselves, since they have no one else to rely on.

### Technicalities:

- In terms of functionality, the user will be able to see the type of dish that they might like to eat (American, Asian, etc...) and then select that dish for steps on how to cook it.

- They will be able to find a dish based on how many calories they will want to consume.

- The user will be able to get a list of required equipment once they find a recipe that they like.

- A list of ingredients will also be provided to the user when they find a recipe.

- The user should be able to save their favorite recipes as well.

- As a stretch goal, users will be able to type in their ingredients and see a list of recipes that can be cooked right now.
